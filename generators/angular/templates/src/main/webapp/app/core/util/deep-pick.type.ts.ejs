/**
 * Utility type for deep picking nested properties using dot-notation paths.
 *
 * @example
 * type Result = DeepPick<IEmployeeSkillCertificate, 'type.id' | 'skill.name' | 'skill.employee.username'>;
 * // Results in:
 * // {
 * //   type: { id: number };
 * //   skill: { name: string; employee: { username: string } };
 * // }
 *
 * Performance note: This type is safe for typical use cases (2-4 levels deep, <20 paths).
 * For very deep nesting or large path unions, consider using manual Pick instead.

type PathHead<P extends string> = P extends `${infer H}.${string}` ? H : P;

// Extract everything after the first segment (after the first dot)
